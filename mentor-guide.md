# Mentor Guide

Most importantly, take a look at the [upstream GSoC guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor) by Google, it will explain most things.
We as a community are still quite new as a community and this document is intended as a place to collect helpful resources for mentors and what works for us.

## Idea template

### Size

- SMALL (90h)
- MEDIUM (175h)
- LARGE (350h)

### Title

The title should be clear, concise and inspiring.

### Description
Here you should explain what the idea is, and why it would be interesting to work on it.
It should only be 2-5 sentences.

### Skills required/preferred
List skills needed/recommended to work on the Project.
A required skill might be prior knowledge off a specific programming language or how to use specific tooling, while some recommended skill might be something like domain specific knowledge or computer science concepts.

### Possible Mentors

- [@your-self](https://github.com/ghost)

And if you know someone else who might be interested, encourage them to apply for becoming a NixOS GSoC mentor.
Note that it's not technically required to mentor yourself, but we can only accept ideas were someone is willing to mentor.

### Difficulty

This should be one of:

- EASY
- MEDIUM
- HARD

Please keep in mind that the ideas here are targeted at beginners while deciding the difficulty rating.
