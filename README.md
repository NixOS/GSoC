It all started here: https://github.com/NixOS/foundation/issues/115

## How to become a mentor

Submit an issue in this repo to propose your candidacy. You will then be added to the team.

We have to set two hard requirements for mentors:
- being capable of fluently speaking English
- having at least a age of 18 year’s or older

## Ideas list

Anyone is free to submit ideas in the form of a PR.
But you should note that we can only accept ideas where people would be willing to mentor them. If an idea is dear to your heart, you know what to do :)
From the [mentor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list):

> Each project on the Ideas list should include: a) a project title/description b) more detailed description of the project (2-5 sentences) c) expected outcomes d) skills required/preferred e) possible mentors f) expected size of project (90, 175 or 350 hour – yes, 3 options starting in 2023). And if possible, an easy, medium or hard rating of each project. This helps the more inexperience folks not get overwhelmed and they can focus on reviewing easy project ideas.

> Don’t be vague about the ideas. Be sure to write a few sentences describing what you need accomplished and not just an overall theoretical version of what you might want.
